# API Documentation

Players are simple REST APIs with **two endpoints**:

* **`/name`**: should provide basic information on a player.
See [Name Endpoint](#name-endpoint) for more information.

* **`/move`**: will receive map information, and needs to reply with the next move for the player.
See the [Move Endpoint](#move-endpoint) for more information.

## Name Endpoint

Your `/name` URL API will receive a **POST** request without body.
Reply with JSON format indicating the **name** of the player or team and the contact **email**.

### Request format

```
POST /name HTTP/1.1
Host: your-api.com
```

### Response format

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "name": string,        // The player or team name
    "email": string        // The contact email
}
```

## Move Endpoint

Your `/move` URL API will receive a POST request with the information about the visible part of the map in JSON format, and you need to reply with the next movement also in JSON format.
See [visible area](#visible-area) section for more information.

### Request format

## Visible area

![starship-screen02.png](images/starship-screen02.png "Game Board")

The board is a 0-based matrix, where [0, 0] is the upper left corner.
The height and width are sent in the `board.size.height` and `board.size.width` vars of the request body in the [Move endpoint](#move-endpoint).

Each player has its own **visible area** based on its current position.
The visible area is sent in the `player.area` var which is an object with four vars `y1`, `x1`, `y2` and `x2`.

The information sent in `board.walls`, `enemies` and `players` vars depends on the **visible area**.

The **fire range** also depends on the visible area.
You can shot at any straight direction (up, down, left or right) and the fire range is limited to what you can see.
